# My first attempt at a Godot multiplayer game:

This went absolutely terrible and had multiple refactors, which made it what it is now.
I definitely learned... stuff, not all that much though. Mainly that multiplayer is hard and I gained even more respect for it.
Godots RPCs and Authority are things I need to look at more and will dive deeper into, because they were the main troublemakers while attempting this multiplayer project.
I liked my concept though and this pirate game will be revived/remade in the future!
